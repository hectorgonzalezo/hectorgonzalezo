---

I'm a Music composer, performer and programmer from Guadalajara, Mexico. Currently living in Connecticut, USA.

I'm interested in interactive computer music, algorithmic composition and gestural controllers.

My music usually employs unique combinations of instruments and controllers, using diverse mapping strategies for each piece.
