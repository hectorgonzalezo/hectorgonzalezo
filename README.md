---

I'm a Music composer, performer and programmer from Guadalajara, Mexico. Currently living in Connecticut, USA.

I'm interested in Electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition and gestural controllers.

My music usually employs unique combinations of instruments and controllers, employing diverse mapping strategies for each piece.
